# nexgensolutions_datacenter
This is our hybrid datacenter(classical supercomputer + Quantum computing + DNA Computing) that will hosts most of our products as a SaaS model, with later on for extensions for PaaS and IaaS offerings if  required. 

This datacenter is a small center that will have various racks, network fabric and various types of processors to handle different types of workloads from classical, quantum Bio-Technology and other synthetic dataset. This is a visionary center that will be the base for NexGen Industrial solutions show case and proof of concept demos. This needs space and investments that can realize such a wonderful center.
